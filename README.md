# Safe
Crack the safe 
This is a guess the number game that takes three inputs instead of one. The input are then converted into an array which is compared to a random array generated. The algorithm checks every item in the array and gives separate result for each index - letting player know which index is correct, high or low. There is a hint section which displays the last guess the player made and the result of each digit in the guess. All previous guesses made are also displayed below the safe. 
The player has 60s seconds to guess the code to the safe. The game is timed using an decrement counter. If the player guesses the code within 60s the safe opens, otherwise the game ends.
The player has the option to stop the background music with the "â™«" button and the keypad sound with the "ðŸ“£" button.

**Finding it hard to beat the timer? Try guessing one digit at a time.**

Good luck!!
